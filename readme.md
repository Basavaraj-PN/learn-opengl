# Learn OpenGL

I am learning from the following resources.
1. The Cherno OpenGL YouTube series 
2. [learnopengl](https://learnopengl.com/)


#### This projects works in both windows and Linux
**Note**: For windows you need to update texture and shader path in [Application.cpp](./src/Application.cpp)
